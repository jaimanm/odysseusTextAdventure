come to a decision node:
1. tell the player the context/situation
2. give 2 different options - one is right, one is wrong
3. prompt player to make a decision

player makes a decision: 
1. get player input (format?)
2. reward/penalize player based on the decision
3. direct player to next decision node based on current decision

Scoring:
If good answer, takes (a couple) days stay at the destination.
If bad answer, takes (a lot of) days stay at the destination.
Should always take a fixed amount of journey time in between nodes

Main game loop {
- run decision node program
- run player decision program
- iterate to the next correct node
}

Extra:
High scores??
